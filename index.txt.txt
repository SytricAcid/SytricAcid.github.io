<h1> The Midnight Train </h1>
<p class="one"> <b> 
In the quiet hours, the midnight train <br> 
rushed through the hills, through mist and rain. <br>
Its whistle broke the silence of night, <br>
a haunting call for those who dared to listen. <br>

</p>
<p class="two"> 
Along the tracks, a young girl waited,
holding dreams close, risking a new path.
Her lantern low, her heart alive,
she watched the train emerge from the fog.
</p>

<p class="three">
One night she chose to board, alone,
to leave behind the only life she knew.
With stars as her guides, she passed her town,
embracing the unknown stretching before her.
</p>

<p class="four">
In far-off lands, she found her truth:
journeys teach in ways stillness never will.
Every mile brought strength she didn’t know she had—
her fear, she learned, had been the only true cage.
